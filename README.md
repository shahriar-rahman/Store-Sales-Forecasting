# Store Sales Forecasting
Forecast the sales (in units) for a family of products in stores.

## Work in Progress
Currently, we are working on multiple projects simultaneously. The work for this project will continue after other projects are concluded.

## Primary Goal:  
Our primary goal is to form a comparative analysis on a time-series dataset from the kaggle competition 'Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting'.

## Datasets:
The following datasets will be studied, observed, and merged for preprocessing before applying to our desired models:
* train.csv
* test.csv
* stores.csv
* oil.csv
* holidays_events.csv

### Sample Submission:
The sample_submission.csv will only be used to perform submission on Kaggle.

## Potential Model Evaluations
The following models are chosen for deep-introspection and comparative analysis based on Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE):
* Linear Regression
* XGBoost
* ARIMA/SARIMA
* LSTM
